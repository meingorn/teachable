Hi Teachable Team!

 I'm so excited about the opportunity to work at Teachable. This repo contains the completed assignment. While the core functionality is complete, I would have loved more time to polish up the details and make the UX more enjoyable. It would be my pleasure to discuss/demonstrate that to you in the coming days.

Thank you so much for your consideration!
